| Sha256 Encryption | 0.25  | Not learning. Its just predicting 0.5 for each bit                                                          |
| Sha256 Decryption | 0.25  | Same as Encryption. Not learning & predicting 0.5                                                           |
| Identity function | 0.193 | After 0.208ish lr dramatically decreased. I feel it is learning but need some help to get over local minima |
